# FavouriteAnything
A [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge) (Discord Mobile) plugin that lets you favourite **any** image or video, not just GIFs!

Ported from the [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) desktop plugin by [nin0dev](https://github.com/nin0dev) & [davri](https://github.com/davri).

## What does it do?
Discord only shows the favourite button on GIFs in the media viewer. This plugin patches `GIFFavButton` to appear on **all media types** (images, videos), so you can save anything to your GIF favourites.

## How to install?
Paste the following URL into the **Plugins** page of Revenge:

```
https://theunrealzaka.github.io/FavouriteAnything/favouriteanything
```
